    Hole Of Problems
### What does this project do?
    Speak out,listen,read,and comment on people's problems.

### Who did you design this project for?
    Everyone, no matter what their gender, race, and position in life is.      
### What was your inspiration for this project?
    We feel that everyone has lots of problems in their life. We wanted to make a website were you can talk about these problems with other people that feel the same way you do. You can pick from one of the major problems or you can make a new problem for people to talk about. .When we think about the word explore, blackhole is what pops out from our mind, so we combine blackhole with the problems of people. The blackhole is a symbol of sucking in the problems and breaking them. This fits the theme disrupt. The word, dare, we think about it as having the courage to share your problems out loud to people you don't know.
### What challenges did you run into?
    Jinglan and Kailin: At first, it is hard for us to create the foundation of the website. After this, we were being able to do some research and work by myself to make our websites looks better.  
    Andres: The first challenge I ran into was rotating the black hole. Giving it the rotating animation was difficult. I had to center it and find the perfect width and height. Also how much degrees it should rotate. I also had to find a way on how to keep the problems from rotating the opposite direction from the hole. 
### What accomplishments are you most proud of?
  Andres: I am most proud of getting the black hole to rotate and have a cool animation. Also getting the random colors and fonts for the text. 
  Jinglan: I am most pround of working together and solving problems together.
  Kailin: I am most proud of communicating sucessfully with other people in my team to turn the project into what we are thinking in mind.
### What did your team learn?
  We learned how to communicate well. We also helped each other out when they were stuck and had questions. We learned about new javascripts : randomization, open new webpages ,generating html and javascript.
